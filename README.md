# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project to create earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.

## Data

- Using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, I'll add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

- Using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, we add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(). We'll also add color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().
